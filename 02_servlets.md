## Servlets Introduction
- Java Servlets are essential components of server-side programming, providing a foundation for developing web applications.
- A servlet is essentially a Java class that extends either `GenericServlet` or `HttpServlet` from the `javax.servlet.http` package.
- By inheriting from these classes, developers implement specific methods to handle incoming requests and generate dynamic responses.

### Key points about Java Servlets:
1. **Servlet Class Hierarchy**
 - Servlets are Java classes that extend `GenericServlet` or `HttpServlet` from the `javax.servlet.http` package.
 - Developers override methods in these classes to define the servlet's behavior in handling requests.

2. **Web Container Responsibilities**
 - Servlets operate within a web container, like Tomcat, which manages the servlet's lifecycle.
 - The web container's role involves handling incoming requests, processing them, generating responses, and sending them back to the web server.

3. **Servlet API**
 - The Servlet API provides various interfaces and classes for creating servlets, such as `GenericServlet`, `HttpServlet`, `ServletRequest`, `ServletResponse`, and `Servlet`.
 - Developers leverage these components to build robust and dynamic web applications.

4. **HTTP Servlets**
 - Java Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes, and HTTP Servlets operate under the HTTP protocol.
 - The HTTP protocol follows an asymmetrical request-response model, where clients send requests, and servers respond with the requested data.

5. **Foundation for Server-Side Technologies**
 - Servlets serve as the foundation for various Java server-side technologies, including JSP (Java Server Pages), JSF (Java Server Faces), Struts, Spring, and Hibernate.
 - These technologies build upon the servlet model, extending and enhancing capabilities for developing feature-rich web applications.
